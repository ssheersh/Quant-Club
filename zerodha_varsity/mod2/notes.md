# Technical Analysis

## Topic 1: Overview
Technical Analysis banks on the market being right.

1. Use TA only in the short term
2. TA only gives you small profits per trade that accumulate
3. Holding period can last from few minutes to few weeks 
4. Risk is dependent on how well you handle losses


## Topic 2: Some fundamentals
### Assumptions:
1. *Markets discount everything*: All known info in and not in the public domain is reflected in the LTP.
2. *The how is more important than the why*: You don't need to understand the underlying motives as long as you know how the stock price actually got affected
3. *Price moves in trend*:All major moves in a market are an outcome of a trend. This is the fundamental idea on which TA works.
4. *History tends to repeat itself*:In TA talk, it means the stock price tends to repeat itself, because market forces tend to react remarkably similar to price movements.

### Trade Summary:
The stock market timings are 9:15 to 15:30 in India. Many trades occur. So we track it by an OHLC chart on different time intervals. We are going to focus on daily patterns but the terminology remains the same

## Topic 3: Candlesticks
### Single Candlestick patterns:
1. ####  Marubuzo:
	* Bullish Marubuzo
	* Bearish Marubuzo

Do not apply the third rule for Marubuzo: either type of Marubuzo can appear in either type of trend.

#### Bullish Marubuzo
Open $\approx$ Low
 
Close $\approx$ High

Risk taker buys it while the Marubuzo is forming while the risk-averse might buy it the next day

Risk-averse might get a deep stop loss if markets turn down but is doubly confirmed if uptrend is going on.

Avg trader buys something like this: Buy-price around the high, and stop-loss at around the low. If stock dips below that low, Marubuzo has failed

In general, buy on a blue candle day and sell on the red candle day. 

#### Bearish Marubuzo
Open $\approx$  High 
Close $\approx$ Low

Risk taker shorts it while the Marubuzo is forming around the close of the same day at about 15:20.

Risk-averse shorts it at the end of second day's closing when he is sure that the market is in a down turn. 

#### Trade trap
Don't apply these candlestick patterns on extremely small or large candles. For extremely small candles, the reason is obvious: there is ambiguity in the direction and thus it's hard to identify direction of the trade. 

On the other hand, lengthy candles indicate extreme activity and thus there is a potential for a deep stop-loss. Although the rewards may be high, in case the pattern fails, the stop-loss would be way too painful

2. #### Spinning tops(color agnostic)
* The candles have a small real body
* The upper and lower shadow are almost equal

Indicates a lot of drama with the stock:
    * A blue top denotes that the bulls tried to take the tock up, but were unsuccessful
    * A red top denotes that the bears tried to pull the stock down but couldn't do it so successfully

Either way, the long shadows indicate that neither the bulls or the bears were able to take much control despite much effort. This means that there is much uncertainity and indecision in the market

#### Spinning tops in a downtrend
In a downtrend, the bears were in absolute control. Thus, such a spinning top indicates two possibilities
 1. There would be another bout of selling
 2. The markets would reverse direction

The trader now needs to prep for both situations. Suppose he was waiting to go long(i.e. buy), he could probably buy this to get in on the possible uptrend. However, to play it safe, he could test by buying only half the quantity. Suppose he wanted 500 shares, he could not go long with 250, and wait and watch. If the stock goes up, the trader can average up by buying again.

If the stock starts to fall, the trader can exit and book a loss, but then the loss is only half of what he originally would've got.

#### Spinning tops in an uptrend
Same possibilities but for the bulls:
1. There would be another bout of buying
2. The markets will reverse direction

Again, the trader needs to be wary. Suppose he had a position in this stock. There's a chance to book profits(i.e. cash out from the previous bull trend). But he shouldn't book profits on full, rather take out 250 shares(running with the 500 example) and wait and watch.

If bears make an entry, he has booked 50% of the profits and can now book the remaining 50% as well as the net selling price would be higher than the market price

If the bulls stay, he doesn't get completely out of the market, and continues to enjoy the bull run, albeit at only half the volume


In summary, the spinning top implies that there is confusion in the markets and that you should minimise your position in that area.

3. #### Dojis
Same implication as spinning tops but even more extreme as there is no real body.

4. ####  Paper Umbrellas(color agnostic)
Two types:
    * Hammer:(Umbrella in a downtrend)
    * Hanging man:(Umbrella in an uptrend)

Feature: long lower shadow that is at least twice the real body's size. Negligible upper shadow

#### Psychology for the hammer

 The bears were in charge during the time of the downfall of the stock. Each day was supposed to be going lower and lower. But then the bullish forces emerged and managed to punch up the price, so that the closing price is nearer to the high than the low. 

This means that bulls have garnered up forces and the market trend may change and trader should take a long

Risk taker might buy stock on the same day as hammer formation at around 15:20, and for him the hammer is color agnostic and no violation of rule 1(buy strength sell weakness). Risk-averse might buy the next day after ensuring that it was a blue candle day.
 
Stop loss is at the point when the price goes below the low of the hammer, at which point the hammer has failed.

#### Psychology for the hanging man

Bulls were in absolute control during the uptrend, characterised by new highs and higher lows. If a hanging man appears, it means the bears have managed to make an entry. 

This means that the trader should now take a short position.

Risk taker might short it around 15:20 of the hanging man day, around closing price. Risk averse should short the closing of the next day ensuring that a red candle appears on the 2nd day.

High of the candle now works as stop-loss, in which case the hanging man fails.

5. #### Shooting stars(color agnostic)
Looks like an inverted paper umbrella, i.e. a long upper shadow at least twice the main body and a negligible lower shadow. Although agnostic, slightly more reliable if shooting star is red.

For a shooting star, the prior trend has to be bullish.

#### Psychology for the shooting star:

The bulls were in control, taking the stock to a new high, but due to some reason, the stock comes back to the extent that it closes to the low point of the day. This means that the bears have entered the market.

This means a time for the trader to short. Risk taker might take a short at the same day as the shooting star is formed at around close time. Risk averse takes a short on next day after ensuring 2nd day is a red candle.
Shorting price is around the closing price, and stop-loss is a t the high of the shooting star at which point it has failed. 

### Multiple Candlestick Patterns

1. #### The Engulfing pattern:
Two types:
* Bullish Engulfing pattern
* Bearish Engulfing pattern
#### Bullish Engulfing pattern
The prior trend has to be a downtrend. The first day (P1) should be a red candle confirming bearishness. But the second day(P2) registers a large enough blue candle so that it engulfs the P1's red candle. 

Psychology is as follows: The P1 candle shows that the bears were in full control, rendering a typical red candle. On the starting of P2, the price still opened at the closing price of P1, but then the bulls suddenly took control and pushed the price upwards, which was unexpected for the bears. This means that the bulls are regaining control and the prices are going to go upwards for sometime now.

The trader should now take a long position.Risk taker might buy the stock on the closing time of P2, ensuring that a candle is now engulfing P1. Risk averse might take it on the day after P2, ensuring a blue candle is made on P2, around the closing price. But if the 3rd day is forming a red candle, the risk averse ignores it.

(It is worth it to take risk on these multi day trade patterns)

Stop loss is the lower low b/w P1 and P2, at which point the pattern has failed. 

It's good enough even if only the real body is engulfed by P2's real body, no need to stick to the textbook definition of the whole candle being engulfed.

#### Bearish engulfing pattern
Appears in an uptrend(mandatory uptrend before).The first day should be a blue candle day, confirming bullishness. But the second day registers a large enough red candle to engulf the P1's blue candle. 

Psychology: P1 shows the bulls were in charge. On the start of P2, the price started to climb higher but the bears suddenly put a lot of effort resulting in massive selling, unexpected for the bulls. This means that the bears are gaining power and prices are going to go on a downturn for now.

The trader should now take a short position. Risk taker initiates on P2 after ensuring that open of P2 is higher than P1's close and that P2's price at 15:20 is lower than P1's open price. Risk averse might initiate short on the third day, after ensuring P3 is a red candle day.

Again, it makes sense to be a risk taker here.

#### Presence of a doji 
In a bearish engulfing pattern, if on P3, there is a doji formation, the bulls are now panicked by the events of P2 and now uncertain from the doji at P3, which means the reins are slipping away, creating weak hands for bulls, and bears now take absoulute control, pushing prices down a spiral.

This creates a very great incentive for the trader to short as the price falls off a cliff.


2. #### Piercing pattern

Quite similar to engulfing pattern. However in this case, P2's candle doesn't completely engulf P1 but partially engulfs it.

Two types: 
* Bullish piercing pattern
* The Dark Cloud cover(basically Bearish piercing pattern)

#### Bullish piercing pattern 
In a bullish piercing pattern, P2's blue candle engulfs between 50% to a 100% of P1's red candle. As long as this is satisfied, all the conclusions of the bullish engulfing pattern apply here. Risk taker initiates the buy at around the closing time of P2's candle after ensuring it pierces it. Risk averse initiates the trade only after ensuring P2 is a blue candle on P3. Stop loss is the lower b/w P1 and P2.

#### The Dark Cloud Cover 
P2's red candle engulfs b/w 50 to 100% of P1's length. Risk taker shorts around closing of P2 while risk averse initiates short on P3 after ensuring P2 is red candle and ignoring if P3 starts forming z blue candle. Stop-loss is higher b/w P1 and P2's candle.

#### Some commentary by the author
Stocks in the same sector have similar price movements. But if they move differently,  trading based on engulfing is much more secure than a piercing pattern simply because the challenging forces a re much more stronger there.

However, soon in the course, we should check these patterns against a checklist of 5-6 conditions. If a piercing condition satisfies more point in a checklist than the engulfing pattern, the piercing will be preferred.

3. #### Harami(Pregnant) Pattern.
P1's candle is a bit significantly long, compared to P2's candle and their colors are opposite. It signifies a trend reversal.Two types:
* Bullish Harami pattern
* Bearish Harami pattern

#### Bullish Harami pattern
The market pattern must be a downtrend before. On P1, a typical red candle is formed. But on day 2, the opening price is higher than previous close, confusing and panicking the bears, which means their hands get weaker and the market gains strength closing on a positive note. Although this candle is short and looks harmless, it is unexpected in such a downtrend. Thus it is a sign that the bulls are back.

The trader now should take a long position. Risk taker might buy it on the closing of P2, after validating the harami pattern, ensuring that opening of P2 is higher than close of P1 and that current price at 15:20 is less than P1's opening price.

Risk averse can initiate long position after ensuring P2 forms a blue candle. The lowest low of the pattern will be the stop loss of the trade.

#### Bearish Harami Pattern
The market was in an uptrend before. On P1, a typical blue candle is formed. But on P2, the market opens lower, panicking the bulls, and things go downhill for the market as it ends on a low just above P1's closing price. This indicates bears are coming over.

The trader now should short the stock.  Risk taker might short it around closing of P2, after confirming signs of harami. 

Risk averse might short it on P3 after ensuring that P2 is a red candle day. 

The highest between P1 and P2 acts as stop loss for short.

#### Gap Up openings

Indicates buyer enthusiasm. Buyers are willing to buy at a price higher than previous day's close. This can, for example, happen after their are good news announcements for the company. Thus the price changes despite no trading activity.

Thus gap up is a bullish sentiment

#### Gap Down openings

Indicates bear enthusiasm. Bears are so eager to sell that they will sell it at a discounted rate from the previous close. This can happen, for example, if a company announces a stupid product. This shows a very bearish sentiment.

4. #### Morning Star 
This evolves over a 3 day period, and is a downtrend reversal pattern. It appears at the bottom of a downtrend.

Psychology of the pattern: Market is in downtrend, bears in charge. On P1, expectedly the stock goes down, makes a new low and forms a long red candle. This large candle shows accelerated selling.

On P2, the stock shows a gap down opening. But then something happens resulting in uncertainity and thus P2 registers a doji or a spinning top.

On P3, the stock then shows a gap up opening, creating helter-skelter in the bears. The bulls gain further control and thus the stock forms a blue candle closing above the opening of P1's candle.

This is essentially an engulfing pattern with a doji stuck in between. And the expectation is that the trends are gonna go up. 
The trader should now take a long position. Both the risk taker and risk averse can now initiate the transaction on P3, as waiting for confirmation on P4 isn't necessary in this pattern.

Trade setup is as follows: Buy the stock at around 15:20 of P3, ensuring that P1, P2 and P3 form a morning star, and validate the following conditions: P1 should be red, P2 should be gap down and a doji/spinning top, and P3 should be a gap up and that price at 15:20 is higher than P1's opening.

The stop-loss is the lowest low of the 3 in this trading pattern.

5. #### Evening Star
This is just the inverse of the Morning star pattern and signifies the reversal of an uptrend, appearing at the top of it. 

Psychology: Market in uptrend, bulls in control. P1 goes up and closes on high, forming a long blue candle, showing buying accelerations.

On P2, it shows a gap up opening. But then something happens resulting in uncertainty resulting in the formation of a doji or spinning top.

On P3, the stock shows a gap down opening, scaring the bulls. The bears are now calling the shots and the stock now forms a red candle lower than P1's opening. 

The expectation now is that the prices will go downtrend.

The trader should now short. Again, both risk taker and risk averse can start on P3.

Trade setup as follows: Short the stock on P3, around 15:20 after validating the following conditions: P1 was a blue candle, P2 was a doji/spinning top, and P3 should be a red candle with a gap down opening. The current price at 15:20 should be lower than P1's opening. 

Stop-loss is now the highest high of these 3 candles.

#### Summary of entries and exits
* Risk taker initiates trade on the last day of pattern formation around the 15:20 mark, after validating the pattern rules.

* Risk averse trades the next day after obtaining confirmation. For a long trade, the color is blue, while for short trade the color is red

* The higher the number of days in a pattern, the better it is to initiate the trade on the same day.

* Stop loss for long is lowest low, and stop-loss for short is the highest high.

## Topic 4: Support and Resistance 
We hadn't discussed target prices before. We are now going to discuss that. The best way to identify target prices is to identify support and resistance points. The S&R are specific points where there is expectation fo massive buying or selling. The support price has much more buyers than sellers and the resistance price has much  more sellers than buyers. 

S&R can also be used to identify entry points as well.

### Resistance
This is the price which the stock is not able to breach, and traders expect maximum amount of supply(selling) for the stock. The resistance is always above the current market price. 

It's very highly probable that the stock is not able to break the resistance and thus it becomes a critical TA tool in a rising market. It often acts as a trigger to sell. 

Resistance can also be used as a target price in a long position, since we know that hitting it generates a whole lot of supply, selling pressure and thus bearish sentiments.

### Support
This is the price from which the stock never goes below, and there is excess buying pressure here. The support is always below the current price.

This is a price at which the price is very likely to bounce back up and thus is a critical TA tool in falling markets. Support often acts as a trigger to buy

Support can be used as a target price in a short position, since we know it creates bullish sentiments

### Construction of Support and Resistance levels
* Step 1: Load data: Short term S&R determination needs 3-6 months of data points. Long term S&R determination needs 12-18 months of data. 


    * Long term S&R: Useful for swing trading(daily, weekly)

    * Short term S&R: Useful for intraday and BTST(buy today, sell tomorrow) trades.

* Step 2: Identify at least 3 price action zones-A price action zone can be described as 'sticky points' on chart where the chart has displayed at least one of the following behaviours:
    * Hesitated to move up further after a brief up move
    * Hesitated to move down further after a brief down move
    * Sharp reversals of pattern at a particular price points
(Kind of like maximum, minimum and inflection points)

* Step 3: Align the price action zones: In a 12 month chart, it is easy to identify many such action zones, but the trick is to identify at least 3 price action zones at the same price level.

An important thing to note is that these aligned price action zones should be well-placed in time to reap maximum confidence that we are accurately identifying the levels. 

* Step 4: Fit a horizontal line: Connect the 3 or more price action zones with a horizontal line. Based on where the line is with respect to current market price, this becomes either a support or a resistance.

There is a risk of approximation when drawing these visuals. So always leave room for error, since this is actually a zone and not a line.

### Reliability of S&R
As with anything in TA, it is all based on probabilities and S&R only provide likelihoods of reversal 

However, well drawn S&Rs with well-spaced time intervals are very-well respected by the stock.


### Optimisation and checklist
It is almost always better to identify good signals that are going to give good returns than identifying millions of tiny trades that are basically worthless (unless you're in HFT?). 

If two signals are giving the same "vibes"(indication), for eg.a bullish  maurbuzo near the support price, it's a much stronger signal to buy than each of them in isolation. 

Thus we can develop a checklist for every trade considered. 

Remember being disciplined and not getting carried away by feelings. 

A beginner checklist can look something like this:
1. The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern
2. S&R should confirm to the trade, and the stop-loss should be around S&R prices i.e. for a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support; for a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance.


## Topic 5: Volumes
Volumes indicate the cumulative number of shares bought and sold over a given period of time. For eg, a transaction where I buy a 100 shares and you sell them to me doesn't result in the volume being 200, but only a 100, since only 100 exchanged hands in this transaction. But a separate transaction of, say 200 shares, would bring up the total volume to 300.

### Volume trend table
Volume as a metric on it's own is quite useless. However, when associated with preceding price and volume trend, this information becomes meaningful.

|Price | Volume | Expectation|
|------|--------|------------|
|Increases| Increases| Bullish|
|Increases| Decreases| Caution: weak hands buying|
|Decreases| Increases| Bearish|
|Decreases| Decreases| Caution: weak hands selling|

The increase in volume is generally referenced with respect to the 10 day moving average of volume.

High Volume => $V_t> \bar{V}_{10d}$ 

Low Volume => $V_t< \bar{V}_{10d}$ 

Average Volume => $V_t\approx \bar{V}_{10d}$ 

Psychology: A large volume implies that institutional investors are showing interest in the stock. Now because they have such a large corpus to maintain, any money they invest has to be well managed and thus is considered smart money. Thus it is considered wise for the retail investor to align itself with the smart money. 

Thus always ensure the volumes are substantial, as you're going with the smart money.

The second and fourth rows are explained by the fact that there is only retail investment happening and thus a trend can't be said to form.

### Updated checklist
1. The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern
2. S&R should confirm the trade, and the stop-loss should be around S&R.
3. Volumes should confirm to the trade.

## Topic 6: Moving Averages
Calculated for the latest n data points. Moving averages for stocks are generally calculated using closing prices as it is the price at which the market finally settles down.

### Simple moving averages
A moving average calculated this way is called a simple moving average or SMA. A moving average over 5 days is called a 5 day SMA, which we could then overlay over the candlestick chart to compare

### Exponential moving averages
An SMA gives equal weightage to each considered data point. However, for something as volatile as stocks, it makes more sense to give weightage to the more recent data than the older one(*markets discount everything*).

By now giving the newness of data importance, we created an exponential set of weights, and using this scaled set of numbers gives us the exponential moving average 

$$
EMA_{i}=\alpha V_i +(1-\alpha) EMA_{i-1}
$$

This is the recurrence relation which gives us the formula to calculate the EMA for a certain $\alpha \in (0,1)$ which is representative of the sanctity we assign to the newness of the value $V$ coming in.

The EMA is more reactive to the movement of prices and thus sticks closer to the candlestick chart prices.

### A simple application of moving averages
Moving averages can be used to identify buying and selling opportunities in its own right. If a stock is trading above the EMA, it means traders are willing to buy it a price higher than the average price, which means they are optimistic and bullish sentiments flourish. Thus the trader should look for buying opportunities. 

If the stock is trading below it's EMA, the traders are pessimistic about its movement and one should look for selling opportunities.

We can try to make a simple trading system based solely on the 50 day EMA. A good system gives signals to enter and a signal to close out of the trade. We can define this system with the following rules:

1. Go long on the stock when the current market price is greater than the 50-day EMA. Once entered the long, you should stay invested until necessary sell is satisfied
2. Exit the long position(square off) when the market price goes below the 50-day EMA.

A particular characteristic of such moving average trading systems is that they perform handsomely in uptrends and downtrends but fail miserably in a side-to-side movement.  Thus a moving average system in it's simplest form is a trend following system. 

Moving averages will give a lot of buy and sell signals in a sideways market which result in worthless trades if not losses. But one of these trades may happen in an upcoming uptrend which may lead to massive gains.

It's really difficult to segregate the big winner from the smaller trades, and thus you should always stick to the system once you adopt it, since the losses are marginal but the gains from one big rally are going to be impressive.

The profit making trade also ensure that the trader is in the trend for as long as the trend lasts, which can last for many months. Thus, MA can be used as proxy for identifying long term investment ideas.

### Moving average crossover system
This is an improvisation over the previous system, which was prone to generating too many signals. 

In an MA crossover system, instead of the single moving average, the trader combines two moving averages. This is referred to as smoothing.

A typical example would be to combine a 50-day EMA with a 100-day EMA. The shorter MA is also referred to as the faster moving average, and the longer the slower. 

The shorter MA sticks closer to the candle chart, and reacts more quickly. The longer MA's reactions are slower.

One trading scheme here has combined the plain MA system with these two MAs to smoothen out. This generate fewer signals, but each of these signals has a higher chance of being a winner. Here are the rules.

1. Buy(fresh long) when the faster MA turns greater than the slower MA. Stay in the trade as long as this is satisfied.
2. Square off when the faster MA goes under the slower MA.


Some popular MA crossover systems are:
1. 9-day x 21-day: for short terms(up to few trading sessions)
2. 25-day x 50-day: medium terms(up to few weeks)
3. 50-day x 100-day: trades last up to a few months
4. 100-day x 200-day: to identify long term trades(investment opportunities), can last a year or more.

Remember, all MA systems are in the end trend following systems.

## Topic 7: Indicators
Indicators a re trading systems on top of what we already discussed based on the experience of successful traders(or maybe maths?). These can be used to help in buying, selling, confirming and sometimes predicting trends.

Indicators are of two types: Leading and Lagging. 

A leading indicator leads the markets i.e. predicts new trends and reversals before they happen. But they are notorious for giving many false signals. Thus the trader should be very careful when using these.

A majority of these leading indicators are called oscillators as they oscillate within a bounded range, with it typically bouncing between the extremes, rarely at the mean. Based on the value, the interpretation may vary.

A lagging indicator lags the market and confirms the trend after it has occurred. This allows traders to cash in on the trend a bit later, but a bit more assuredly. Moving averages is such a lagging indicator.

Momentum: The rate at which price changes. The more rapid the change, the higher the momentum(either upwards or downwards)

### Relative Strength Index-RSI
Developed by J. Welles Wilder. It's a leading momentum indicator which helps in identifying a trend reversal. RSI oscillates between 0 and 100 and based on latest indicator reading, the expectations are set.

RSI does not compare, and gives out strongest signals during the period of sideways and non-trending ranges.

The formula to calculate is as follows:
$$ RSI=100\Big(\frac{RS}{1+RS}\Big)=100-\frac{100}{1+RS}$$
$$RS= \frac{\text{Average Gain}}{\text{Average loss}}$$

Average gain is the gain in points computed over the number of days observed. Say we observe for two days a stock that was 100 on day 0.

|Day|Close|Points Gain| Points lost|
|---|-----|-----------|------------|
|1  |104  |4          |0           |
|2  |102  |0          |2           |
|Tot|102  |4          |2           |
$$\text{Average gain}=\frac{Total \ gain}{Number\ of\ days}=\frac{4}{2}=2$$
$$\text{Average loss}=\frac{Total \ loss}{Number\ of\ days}=\frac{2}{2}=1$$
$$RS=\frac{2}{1}=2$$
$$RSI=100-\frac{100}{1+2}\approx 100-33.3=66.7$$
Now obviously RSI is calculated over a larger number of days. Typically a 14 period RSI is used.
Now $RSI \in [0,100)$:
* When $RSI \in [0,30]$ the security is supposed to be oversold and thus there is probably going to be an upward correction.
* When $RSI \in [70,100)$ the security is supposed to be overbought and there is probably going to be a downward correction. 

However, remember that RSI generated the most trusty signals in a sideways market. Consider the following scenarios:
* In an uptrend, the RSI is consistently stuck in the 100 region
* In a downtrend, the RSI is consistently stuck in the 0 region.

Thus:
1. If RSI is fixed for a long time in 100 region(overbought), look for buying instead of shorting.
2. If RSI is fixed for a long time in 0 region(oversold), look for shorting instead of buying
3. If RSI starts moving away from 0 region after a long time(above 30), look to take a long position as a stock may have botommed out in the downtrend.
4. If RSI starts moving away from the 100 region after a long time(below 70), look to take a short position has the stock may have topped out


#### Note of caution
None of the parameters should be used with rigidity. For example, the 14 day is just what Wilder needed in the days of 1978(Pink Floyd's the Wall had just come out and would not top the chart until weeks later). The 0 to 30 and 70 to 100 was also what worked for Wilder. 

As the trader gains more experience, these parameters are fine-tuned by them.
 

### Moving Average Convergence and Divergence- MACD
Developed by Gerald Appel in the late 70s(Pink Floyd domination and the Oil Crisis? Terrible time to live, awesome time to listen and short stocks).

MACD is considered the grandfather indicator and still used by traders(duh!), and still considered one of the most reliable indicators by momentum traders.

MACD is all about the convergence(hold me closer)/divergence(so far away) of two moving averages.

A standard MACD is calculated using a 12-day x 26-day EMA, based on the closing prices. We subtract the 26-day EMA from 12-day EMA to estimate the convergence-divergence(CD) value. A simple line graph of this value is called the MACD line.

$$MACD= EMA_{12d}-EMA_{26d}$$
$$MACD \in (-\infty, \infty)$$ 

* A positive MACD indicates the stock is moving up.
* A negative MACD indicates the stock is moving down.

Some traders argue that going by the MACD means missing out on most of the action and being late to the party. To overcome this, there is an improvisation in the form of an additional MACD component called the 9 day signal line. This 9 day signal line is the 9-day EMA of the MACD line.


Thus we now have two lines, the MACD and the 9-day EMA of MACD, and we can now devise a trading system based on these two, and no longer wait for the x-axis crossover.

1. The sentiment is bullish when MACD crosses above the 9 day EMA, and trader should look for buying opportunities.
2. The sentiment is bearish when MACD crosses below the 9-day EMA, and the trader should look for selling opportunities.

Remember, that at the end of the day MACD trends are based on MAs and thus show similar properties like MA systems i.e. they work quite well in uptrends and downtrends, but not in a sideways market. 

Again, the parameters of MACD aren't set in stone.

### Bollinger bands

Introduced by John Bollinger in the 1980s, BBs are a reliable indicator used in TA to determine overbought and oversold levels, where a trader will short when it reaches the top of the band and buys when it reaches the bottom of the band.

BB has 3 components:
1. Middle line which is the 20-day SMA of the close prices
2. Upper band:$+2\sigma$ of the middle line
3. Lower band:$-2\sigma$ of the middle line

*Standard deviation*($\sigma$) characterises the *volatility* in finance and both terms are used interchangeably.

(Here, $\sigma$ is calculated using the data points from the 20 data points in tha 20-day EMA)

The expectation is that the stock doesn't wander too far from its average, and a price $2\sigma$ means a stock is too expensive relative to its inner worth and hence needs to come down and vice versa for lower line.

BB works like this for trending patterns. If, for example, the stock sticks closer to the upper band, with time, the BB will expand to envelope the stock back. This is called envelope expansion, but this seems to be a failure of the signals generated by the BB.

Thus BB works in a sideways market but fails in a trending market.


##### A note on indicators:
There are hundreds of technical indicators,but one should focus on a few good ones and develop on these gradually with experience
### The checklist:
Indicators occupy a lower priority in the checklist than the previous concepts discussed. If these indicators confirm, they kind of act like a multiplier effect, or reducing the volume if the other checks confirm but the indicators don't

The checklist:
1. The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern.
2. S&R should confirm and stop-losses should be around S&R.
3. Volumes should confirm
4. Indicators should confirm:

    i. Scale the size higher if they confirm

    ii. If they don't confirm go ahead with the plan but reduce the volume.

## Topic 8: The Fibonacci Retracements

Fibonacci patterns appear almost everywhere, and they have a use in the stock market. But first, some mathematical observations.

$$S_{fib}=0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610$$
$$ a_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}$$
$$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}}=\phi\approx 1.618 $$
$$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_{n}}=\frac{1}{\phi}=\phi-1\approx 0.618 $$
$$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n-2}}{a_{n}}=\frac{1}{\phi^2}\approx 0.382 $$
$$ \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} \frac{a_{n-3}}{a_{n}}=\frac{1}{\phi^3}\approx 0.236 $$


### The relevance to stock markets
61.8%, 38.2% and 23.6% are often the percentage of retracements after an uptick. This analysis can be applied when there is a noticeable uptick or downtick in the market. Every trend usually retraces back before jumping again.

This retracement level forecast is a technique using which one can identify up to which level retracement happens. These retracements are good opportunities to enter  new positions in directions of the trend and position themselves for trade.

For example, if a stock jumps, it may first retrace to 23.6% level, but if it further corrects, it may go to 38.2% and 61.8% levels. 

Similar pattern can be applied to a bounce back after a slump.
First bounce back 23.6% then if further, 38.2% and 61.8%

### Fibonacci Retracement construction
As we saw, Fibonacci retracements are movements that go against the trend. To use this Fibonacci retracement, we have to identify the 100% move, which can be an upward or downward rally. Once identified, we connect using Fibonacci retracement tool, available in most major trading platforms. Connect the trough and the crust of the 100% movement.

#### How to use the retracements
If for example you wanted to buy a stock but then the price suddenly spiked up, the correction provides an opportunity to enter, which we can identify this with Fibonaccis, but only after confirming the other things in checklist i.e. forms a candlestick pattern, stop-loss is at S&R level, and volumes are average. 
Now if the stop loss also coincides with  Fibonacci then it allows for a strong buy. 


## Topic 9: The Dow Theory
Been around since before the candlesticks, but still revered in the western world, and a blend of candlesticks and Dow theory is used. 

Introduced by CHarles H Dow who founded the Dow Jones financial news service (now the Wall Street Journal), in which he defined Dow Theory in a series of articles. Will P Hamilton then popularised over 27 years. 

There are many critics since much has changed since the 1900s(global hegemony, global economy and the dollar or pound, and of course music).

### The Dow Theory Principles
These are 9 tenets: 
1. *Indices discount everything*: The stock market indices show every info known and unknown, and recalibrates quickly to any sudden and unexpected event.

2. *There are 3 broad trends in the market overall*: Primary, Secondary and Minor trend

3. *The Primary Trend*: This is the major trend that lasts from a year to several years and indicates the broader multilayer direction of the market. While the long investor may be interested in only this trend, an active trader interests himself in all trends. This primary trend could be an uptrend or a downtrend

4. *The Secondary Trend*: These are corrections to the primary trend. It's useful to think of this as counter reactions to the larger movement like corrections in bull markets and rallies in bearish markets. This lasts from a few weeks to several months.

5. *Minor trends*: Daily fluctuations in the market which some traders call market noise.

6. *All indices must confirm with each other*: We can't confirm a trend based on just one index. For example, the market is bullish only if CNX Nifty, Midcap and Smallcap all move in the same upward direction, not just the CNX Nifty alone.

7. *Volumes must confirm*: The volumes must confirm along with the prices, i.e. in an uptrend the volume rises with price and falls with it; In a downtrend, volumes increase as the price falls and reduce when the price increases.

8. *Sideways markets can substituted secondary markets*: Markets may remain sideways for an extended period and this can be substituted for a secondary trend.

9. *The closing price is the most sacred*: Close is the most sacred as this is what the market decided the stock was worth literally at the end of the day.


The Dow theory suggests the markets are made of 3 distinct phases, which are self repeating, These are called the **accumulation phase**, the **Mark-up phase**, and the **Distribution Phase**. 

The accumulation phase occurs right after a steep sell off in the market that would have frustrated many markets participants, which lose any hope of an uptrend. This is where the 'Smart Money' comes in. 

The 'Smart Money' is usually investors who invest for a long term perspective. They invariably seek value investments which is available after such a steep drop. They start to acquire these shares regularly in large volumes over an extended period of time, This is what makes the accumulation phase. The sellers in these phase can also easily find buyers, and prices don't decline further. This is the bottom of the market, and how Support levels are created.

Once the 'Smart Money' absorbs most of this stock, short term traders sense a support forming, which coincides with a bullish sentiment. This rallies the stock to a higher level, initiating the Mark-up phase, where the stock rallies quickly and sharply. The public at large is left out of the rally as people speculate.

Finally when the stock reaches a new high, everyone is talking about the stock and the public starts to invest in it, and this marks the starting of distribution phase. 

The 'Smart Money' and short term traders who got on early will now book profits and offload shares slowly . The public absorbs this selling and provides a support price. This phase has similar properties to accumulation phase. In this phase whenever the prices attempt to go higher, the 'Smart Money' books profits and sells, ultimately loading off their holdings. Over time, this action repeats itself and a resistance level is created.

Finally when the 'Smart Money' is completely off-loaded, there is no support for prices and hence what follows is a complete sell-off and prices falling down the floor, in a phase known as the Markdown Phase.

This cycle then repeats with a fresh accumulation phase. This cycle lasts over a few years. 

It is important to know that no two market cycles are the same, and the timing of these phases can vary a lot.

The trader now has to form the mentality of looking at the market as being in different phases. 

### The Dow Patterns
Like in candlesticks, there are a few important patterns in Dow Theory as well, which can be used to identify opportunities. Some patterns of interest:

1. The Double bottom & Double Top formations
2. The Triple Bottoms & Triple Tops
3. Range formation
4. Flag formation

The support and resistance is also a core concept for Dow Theory, but we already discussed a lot about it before, so... here we jump into the patterns.

1. #### The Double bottom & Double top formations

These are  considered trend reversal patterns. 

A double bottom occurs when the price of a stock hits a particular low price level and rebounds back with a quick recovery. Following this, the stock trades at a higher level relative to the low price for at least two weeks(well placed in time). After which the stock attempts to hit back the low price previously made. If the stock holds up and rebounds, a double bottom has formed. 


A double bottom is considered bullish and hence one should look at buying opportunities.


A double top occurs when the price hits a particular high level but then slumps back, before attempting and backing down again, with the gap being two weeks. 

This double top is considered a bearish pattern and one should look for selling opportunities.

This is doubly confirmed if a similar signaling candlestick occurs there.

2. #### The triple top and bottoms
Similar to double bottoms and tops accept the prices are tested thrice. Same implications too. 

As a rule, the more number of times the same price is tested, the more sacred it becomes, kind of like S&R

3. #### Trading range
This is an extension to the idea of tops and bottoms. The range forms when prices repeatedly hit these levels forming a sideways market or sideways drift. Both the bulls and bears are unsure where the market goes and leaves the long term investors really frustrated.

However, a short term trader can look for opportunities(buy and sell) with reasonable accuracy. The upside capped by resistance and downside capped by the support.

A sideways market with this behaviour is perfect place to blend candlestick patterns with Dow Theory:

    i. The bullish engulfing suggests a long

    ii. Morning doji star suggests a long
 
    iii. Bearish engulfing pattern suggests a short 
    
    iv. Bearish harami pattern suggests a short

These are easy to identify with high chance of being profitable. The duration of range can be anywhere between 2 weeks to 2 years. The longer the duration, the wider the range.


### Range breakouts
Stocks do breakout of ranges after a long time. But before the breakout, we need to understand why stocks trade in ranges in the first place.

This happens for two reasons: 
* When there are no meaningful fundamental triggers that can move the stock – think major announcements, new products, geographic expansion, change in management. When there is no exciting or worrying news, the stock is stuck. This stock may remain here for a long time until a meaningful trigger.
* In anticipation of a big announcement- When market expects a big announcement the stock can swing wildly in wither direction based on the outcome of the announcement. Until the announcement both buyers and sellers are unsure and thus stock enters a range. This range is usually short-lived.

A breakout more often than not suggests a trend formation. The direction is based on the trigger or announcement but what matters is that a breakout happened. However, be wary of a false breakout.

A false breakout when the trigger isn't strong enough to pull the stock in a particular direction. A false breakout happens when a 'not so trigger friendly' even occurs and impatient retail investors react to it. The volumes here are generally low, which means no smart money here. After this false breakout, the stock falls back into the range. 

A true breakout has:
* High volumes
* High momentum

### Trading the breakout
Traders buy the stock as soon as the stock breaks out of range with good volumes. However, there aren't any good ways to figure out momentums will continue to build. Hence the trader should always have stop-losses here as well.

So, if a trader buys above the resistance, the stop-loss is the resistance, while the stop-loss for shorting below the support is the support.

The target can then be the upper price of a range which has a width equivalent to the original range.

4. #### Flag formation
This usually takes place when the stock posts a sustained rally with a steep, almost vertical increase in prices. This pattern is marked by big move+short correction. In the correction phase, the price would generally move within two parallel lines. These patterns take shape of parallelogram or rectangles and have appearances of flag on the pole. The price decline usually lasts b/w 5 and 15 sessions.

The flag allows trader to buy in on the stock again but in a very short time window as prices may jump up again.

Psychology: Market participants are eager to book in profits after the steep rally and sell the stock, which leads to a decline. The smart money is still invested in and only retail investors are doing stuff, leading to the volume being lower. The sentiment is still positive, and the stock rallies back.

### The Reward to Risk Ratio(RRR)
This is a generic concept not limited to Dow Theory. However, this finds itself being used throughout finance and trading, be it technical or fundamental analysis.

The calculation is very simple. For example, take this short term trade as follows:
Entry($E$): 55.75
Target($T$):57.20
Stop-loss($S$):53.55

The Reward is $T-E=1.45$ while the risk is $E-S=2.2$ so the $RRR=\frac{1.45}{2.2}\approx 0.65<1$, thus the trade isn't worth it.
A good trade should be characterised by a rich RRR. Risk takers might take a lower RRR(say close to 1) while more risk averse might take an RRR upwards of 2. 

A beginner should have very high RRR as it provides a margin of safety. 

A trade should qualify the trader's RRR requirement and appetite for risk. Otherwise it's just not worth the risk.

### The Grand checklist
- [ ] The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern.
- [ ] S&R should confirm to the trade and stop-loss prices should be around S&R.
    * For a long trade, low of the pattern should be around support
    * For a short trade, high of the pattern should be around resistance.
- [ ] Volumes should confirm
    * Ensure above average volumes on both buy and sell day.
    * Low volumes are not encourage, and be cautious while making trades when volumes are low. 
- [ ] Look st the trade from Dow Theory perspective:
    * Primary and secondary trends. 
    * Double, triple, and range formation
    * Recognisable Dow formation
- [ ] Indicators should confirm
    * If the indicators confirm, scale the trade size higher. 
    * If they don't confirm, still go ahead but reduce the trading size.
- [ ] RRR should be satisfactory
    * For an active trader, an RRR of 1.5 seems satisfactory.
