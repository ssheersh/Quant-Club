# Technical Analysis

## Topic 1: Overview
Technical Analysis banks on the market being right.

1. Use TA only in the short term
2. TA only gives you small profits per trade that accumulate
3. Holding period can last from few minutes to few weeks 
4. Risk is dependent on how well you handle losses


## Topic 2: Some fundamentals
### Assumptions:
1. *Markets discount everything*: All known info in and not in the public domain is reflected in the LTP.
2. *The how is more important than the why*: You don't need to understand the underlying motives as long as you know how the stock price actually got affected
3. *Price moves in trend*:All major moves in a market are an outcome of a trend. This is the fundamental idea on which TA works.
4. *History tends to repeat itself*:In TA talk, it means the stock price tends to repeat itself, because market forces tend to react remarkably similar to price movements.

### Trade Summary:
The stock market timings are 9:15 to 15:30 in India. Many trades occur. So we track it by an OHLC chart on different time intervals. We are going to focus on daily patterns but the terminology remains the same

## Topic 3: Candlesticks
### Single Candlestick patterns:
1. Marubuzo:
	* Bullish Marubuzo
	* Bearish Marubuzo

Do not apply the third rule for Marubuzo: either type of Marubuzo can appear in either type of trend.

#### Bullish Marubuzo
