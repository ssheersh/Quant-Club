# Technical Analysis

## Topic 1: Overview
Technical Analysis banks on the market being right.

1. Use TA only in the short term
2. TA only gives you small profits per trade that accumulate
3. Holding period can last from few minutes to few weeks 
4. Risk is dependent on how well you handle losses


## Topic 2: Some fundamentals
### Assumptions:
1. *Markets discount everything*: All known info in and not in the public domain is reflected in the LTP.
2. *The how is more important than the why*: You don't need to understand the underlying motives as long as you know how the stock price actually got affected
3. *Price moves in trend*:All major moves in a market are an outcome of a trend. This is the fundamental idea on which TA works.
4. *History tends to repeat itself*:In TA talk, it means the stock price tends to repeat itself, because market forces tend to react remarkably similar to price movements.

### Trade Summary:
The stock market timings are 9:15 to 15:30 in India. Many trades occur. So we track it by an OHLC chart on different time intervals. We are going to focus on daily patterns but the terminology remains the same

## Topic 3: Candlesticks
### Single Candlestick patterns:
1. ####  Marubuzo:
	* Bullish Marubuzo
	* Bearish Marubuzo

Do not apply the third rule for Marubuzo: either type of Marubuzo can appear in either type of trend.

#### Bullish Marubuzo
Open $\approx$ Low
 
Close $\approx$ High

Risk taker buys it while the Marubuzo is forming while the risk-averse might buy it the next day

Risk-averse might get a deep stop loss if markets turn down but is doubly confirmed if uptrend is going on.

Avg trader buys something like this: Buy-price around the high, and stop-loss at around the low. If stock dips below that low, Marubuzo has failed

In general, buy on a blue candle day and sell on the red candle day. 

#### Bearish Marubuzo
Open $\approx$  High 
Close $\approx$ Low

Risk taker shorts it while the Marubuzo is forming around the close of the same day at about 15:20.

Risk-averse shorts it at the end of second day's closing when he is sure that the market is in a down turn. 

#### Trade trap
Don't apply these candlestick patterns on extremely small or large candles. For extremely small candles, the reason is obvious: there is ambiguity in the direction and thus it's hard to identify direction of the trade. 

On the other hand, lengthy candles indicate extreme activity and thus there is a potential for a deep stop-loss. Althought the rewards may be high, in case the pattern fails, the stop-loss would be way too painful

2. #### Spinning tops(color agnostic)
* The candles have a small real body
* The upper and lower dhadow are almost equal

Indicates a lot of drama with the stock:
    * A blue top denotes that the bulls tried to take the tock up, but were unsuccessful
    * A red top denotes that the bears tried to pull the stock down but couldn't do it so successfully

Either way, the long shadows indicate that neither the bulls or the bears were able to take much control despite much effort. This means that there is much uncertainity and indecision in the market

#### Spinning tops in a downtrend
In a downtrend, the bears were in absolute control. Thus, such a spinning top indicates two possibilities
 1. There would be another bout of selling
 2. The markets would reverse direction

The trader now needs to prep for both situations. Suppose he was waiting to go long(i.e. buy), he could probably buy this to get in on the possible uptrend. However, to play it safe, he could test by buying only half the quantity. Suppose he wanted 500 shares, he could noe go long with 250, and wait and watch. If the stock goes up, the trader can average up by buying again.

If the stock starts to fall, the trader can exit and book a loss, but then the loss is only half of what he originally would've got.

#### Spinning tops in an uptrend
Same possibilities but for the bulls:
1. There would be another bout of buying
2. The markets will reverse direction

Again, the trader needs to be wary. Suppose he had a position in this stock. There's a chance to book profits(i.e. cash out from the previous bull trend). But he shouldn't book profits on full, rather take out 250 shares(running with the 500 example) and wait and watch.

If bears make an entry, he has booked 50% of the profits and can now book the remaining 50% as well as the net selling price would be higher than the market price

If the bulls stay, he doesn't get completely out of the market, and continues to enjoy the bull run, albeit at only half the volume


In summary, the spinning top implies that there is confusion in the amrkets and that you should minimise your position in that area.

3. #### Dojis
Same implication as spinning tops but even more extreme as there is no real body.

4. ####  Paper Umbrellas(color agnostic)
Two types:
    * Hammer:(Umbrella in a downtrend)
    * Hanging man:(Umbrella in an uptrend)

Feature: long lower shadow that is atleast twice the real body's size. Negligible upper shadow

#### Psychology for the hammer

 The bears were in charge during the time of the downfall of the stock. Each day was supposed to be going lower and lower. But then the bullish forces emerged and managed to punch up the price, so that the closing price is nearer to the high than the low. 

This means that bulls have garnered up forces and the market trend may change and trader should take a long

Risk taker might buy stock on the same day as hammer formation at around 15:20, and for him the hammer is color agnostic and no violation of rule 1(buy strength sell weakness). Risk-averse might buy the next day after ensureing that it was a blue candle day.
 
Stop loss is at the point when the price goes below the low of the hammer, at which point the hammer has failed.

#### Psychology for the hanging man

Bulls were in absolute control during the uptrend, characterised by new highs and higher lows. If a hanging man appears, it means the bears have managed to make an entry. 

This means that the trader should now take a short position.

Risk taker might short it around 15:20 of the hanging man day, around closing price. Risk averse should short the closing of the next day ensuring that a red candle appears on the 2nd day.

High of the candle now works as stop-loss, in which case the hanging man fails.

5. #### Shooting stars(color agnostic)
Looks like an inverted paper umbrella, i.e. a long upper shadow at least twice the main body and a negligible lower shadow. Although agnostic, slightly more reliable if shooting star is red.

For a shooting star, the prior trend has to be bullish.

#### Psychology for the shooting star:

The bulls were in control, taking the stock to a new high, but due to some reason, the stock comes back to the extent that it closes to the low point of the day. This means that the bears have entered the market.

This means a time for the trader to short. Risk taker might take a short at the same day as the shooting star is formed at around close time. Risk averse takes a short on next day after ensuring 2nd day is a red candle.
Shorting price is around the closing price, and stop-loss is a t the high of the shooting star at which point it has failed. 

### Multiple Candlestick Patterns

1. #### The Engulfing pattern:
Two types:
* Bullish Engulfing pattern
* Bearish Engulfing pattern
#### Bullish Engulfing pattern
THe prior trend has to be a downtrend. The first day (P1) should be a red candle onfirming bearishness. But the second day(P2) registers a large enough blue candle so that it engulfs the P1's red candle. 

Psychology is as follows: The P1 candle shows that the bears were in full control, rendering a typical red candle. On the starting of P2, the price still opened at the closing price of P1, but then the bulls suddenly took control and pushed the price upwards, which was unexpected for the bears. This means that thebulls are regaining control and the prices are going to go upwards for sometime now.

The trader should now take a long position.Risk taker might buy the stock on the closing time of P2, ensuring that a the candle is now engulfing P1. Risk averse might take it on the day after P2, ensuring a blue candle is made on P2, around the closing price. But if the 3rd day is forming a red candle, the risk averse ignores it.

(It is worth it to take risk on these multiday trade patterns)

Stop loss is the lower low b/w P1 and P2, at which point the pattern has failed. 

It's good enough even if only the real body is engulfed by P2's real body, no need to stick to the textbook definition of the whole candle being engulfed.

#### Bearish engulfing pattern
Appears in an uptrend(mandatory uptrend before).The first day should be a blue candle day, confirming bullishness. But the second day registers a large enough red candle to engulf the P1's blue candle. 

Psychology: P1 shows the bulls were in charge. On the start of P2, the price started to climb higher but the bears suddenly put a lot of effort resulting in massive selling, unexpected for the bulls. This means that the bears are gaining power and prices are going to go on a downturn for now.

The trader should now take a short position. Risk taker initiates on P2 after ensuring that open of P2 is higher than P1's close and that P2's price at 15:20 is lower than P1's open price. Risk averse might initiate short on the third day, after ensuring P3 is a red candle day.

Again, it makes sense to be a risk taker here.

#### Presence of a doji 
In a bearish engulfing pattern, if on P3, there is a doji formation, the bulls are now panicked by the events of P2 and now uncertain from the doji at P3, which means the reins are slipping away, creating weak hands for bulls, and bears now take absoulute ontrol, pushing prices down a spiral.

This creates a very great incentive for the trader to short as the price falls off a cliff.


2. #### Piercing pattern

Quite similar to engulfing pattern. However in this case, P2's candle doesn't completely engulf P1 but partially engulfs it.

Two types: 
* Bullish piercing pattern
* The Dark Cloud cover(basically Bearish piercing pattern)

#### Bullish piercing pattern 
In a bullish piercing pattern, P2's blue candle engulfs between 50% to a 100% of P1's red candle. As long as this is satisfied, all the conclusions of the bullish engulfing pattern apply here. Risk taker initiates the buy at arounf the closing time of P2's candle after ensuring it pierces it. Risk averse initiates the trade only after ensuring P2 is a blue candle on P3. Stop loss is the lower b/w P1 and P2.

#### The Dark Cloud Cover 
P2's red candle engulfs b/w 50 to 100% of P1's length. Risk taker shorts around closing of P2 while risk averse initiates short on P3 after ensuring P2 is red candle and ignoring if P3 starts forming z blue candle. Stop-loss is higher b/w P1 and P2's candle.

#### Some commentary by the author
Stocks in the same sector have similar price movements. But if they move differently,  trading based on engulfing is much more secure than a piercing pattern simply because the contednign forces a re much more stronger there.

However, soon in the course, we should check these patterns against a checklist of 5-6 conditions. If a piercing condition satisfies more point in a checklist than the engulfing pattern, the piercing will be preferred.

3. #### Harami(Pregnant) Pattern.
P1's candle is a bit significantly long, compared to P2's candle and their colors are opposite. It signifies a trend reversal.Two types:
* Bullish Harami pattern
* Bearish Harami pattern

#### Bullish Harami pattern
The market pattern must be a downtrend before. On P1, a typical red candle is formed. But on day 2, the opening price is higher than previous close, confusing and panicking the bears, which means their hands get weaker and the market gains strength closing on a positive note. Although this candle is short and looks harmless, it is unexpected in such a downtrend. Thus it is a sign that the bulls are back.

The trader now should take a long position. Risk taker might buy it on the closing of P2, after validating the harami pattern, ensuring that opening of P2 is higher than close of P1 and that current price at 15:20 is less than P1's opening price.

Risk averse can initiate long position after ensuring P2 forms a blue candle. The lowest low of the pattern will be the stop loss of the trade.

#### Bearish Harami Pattern
The market was in an uptrend before. On P1, a typical blue candle is formed. But on P2, the market opens lower, panicking the bulls, and things go downhill for the market as it ends on a low just above P1's closing price. This indicates bears are coming over.

The trader now should short the stock.  Risk taker might short it around closing of P2, after confirming signs of harami. 

Risk averse might short it on P3 after ensuring that P2 is a red candle day. 

The highest between P1 and P2 acts as stop loss for short.

#### Gap Up openings

Indicates buyer enthusiasm. Buyers are willing to buy at a price higher than previous day's close. This can, for example, happen after their are good news announcements for the company. Thus the price changes despite no trading activity.

Thus gap up is a bullish sentiment

#### Gap Down openings

Indicates bear enthusiasm. Bears are so eager to sell that they will sell it at a discounted rate from the previous close. This can happen, for example, if a company announces a stupid product. This shows a very bearish sentiment.

4. #### Morning Star 
This evolves over a 3 day period, and is a downtrend reversal pattern. It appears at the bottom of a downtrend.

Psychology of the pattern: Market is in downtrend, bears in charge. On P1, expectedly the stock goes down, makes a new low and forms a long red candle. This large candle shows accelerated selling.

On P2, the stock shows a gap down opening. But then something happens resulting in uncertainity and thus P2 registers a doji or a spinning top.

On P3, the stock then shows a gap up opening, creating helter-skelter in the bears. The bulls gain further control and thus the stock forms a blue candle closing above the opening of P1's candle.

This is essentially an engulfing pattern with a doji stuck in between. And the expectation is that the trends are gonna go up. 
The trader should now take a long position. Both the risk taker and risk averse can now initiate the transaction on P3, as waiting for confirmation on P4 isn't necessary in this pattern.

Trade setup is as follows: Buy the stock at around 15:20 of P3, ensuring that P1, P2 and P3 form a morning star, and validate the following conditions: P1 should be red, P2 should be gap down and a doji/spinning top, and P3 should be a gap up and that price at 15:20 is higher than P1's opening.

The stop-loss is the lowest low of the 3 in this trading pattern.

5. #### Evening Star
This is just the inverse of the Morning star pattern and signifies the reversal of an uptrend, appearing at the top of it. 

Psychology: Market in uptrend, bulls in control. P1 goes up and closes on high, forming a long blue candle, showing buying accelerations.

On P2, it shows a gap up opening. But then something happens resulting in uncertainity resulting in the formation of a doji or spinning top.

On P3, the stock shows a gap down opening, scaring the bulls. The bears are now calling the shots and the stock now forms a red candle lower than P1's opening. 

The expectation now is that the prices will go downtrend.

The trader should now short. Again, both risk taker and risk averse can start on P3.

Trade setup as follows: Short the stock on P3, around 15:20 after validating the following conditions: P1 was a blue candle, P2 was a doji/spinning top, and P3 should be a red candle with a gap down opening. The current price at 15:20 should be lower than P1's opening. 

Stop-loss is now the highest high of these 3 candles.

#### Summary of entries and exits
* Risk taker initiates trade on the last day of pettern formation around the 15:20 mark, after validating the pattern rules.

* Risk averse trades the next day after obtaining confirmation. For a long trade, the color is blue, while for short trade the color is red

* The higher the number of days in a pattern, the better it is to initiate the trade on the same day.

* Stop loss for long is lowest low, and stop-loss for short is the highest high.

## Topic 4: Support and Resistance 
We hadn't discussed target prices before. We are now going to discuss that. The best way to identify target prices is to identify suppor tand resistance points. The S&R are specific points where there is expectation fo massive buying or selling. The support price has much mor ebuyers than sellers and the resistance price has much  more sellers than buyers. 

S&R can also be used to identify entry points as well.

### Resistance
This is the price which the stock is not able to breach, and traders expect amximum amount of supply(selling) for the stock. The resistance is always above the current market price. 

It's very highly probable that the stock is not able to break the resistance and thus it bacomes a critical TA tool in a rising market. It often acts as a trigger to sell. 

Resistance can also be used as a target price in a long position, since we know that hitting it generates a whole lot of supply, selling pressure and thus bearish sentiments.

### Support
This is the price from which the stock never goes below, and there is excess buying pressure here. The support is always below the current price.

This is a price at which the price is very likely to bounce back up and thus is a critical TA tool in falling markets. Support often acts as a trigger to buy

Support can be used as a target price in a short position, since we know it creates bullish sentiments

### Construction of Support and Resistance levels
* Step 1: Load data: Short term S&R determination needs 3-6 months of data points. Long term S&R determination needs 12-18 months of data. 


    * Long term S&R: Useful for swing trading(daily, weekly)

    * Short term S&R: Useful for intraday and BTST(buy today, sell tomorrow) trades.

* Step 2: Identify at least 3 price action zones-A price action zone can be described as 'sticky points' on chart where the chart has displayed at least one of the following behaviours:
    * Hesitated to move up further after a brief up move
    * Hesitated to move down further after a brief down move
    * Sharp reversals of pattern at a particular price points
(Kind of like maximas, minimas and inflection points)

* Step 3: Align the price action zones: In a 12 month chart, it is easy to identify many such action zones, but the trick is to identify at least 3 price action zones at the same price level.

An important thing to note is that these aligned price action zones should be well-placed in time to reap maximimum confidence that we are accurately identifying the levels. 

* Step 4: Fit a horizontal line: Connect the 3 or more price action zones with a horizontal line. Based on where the line is with respect to current market price, this becomes either a support or a resistance.

There is a risk of approximation when drawing these visuals. So always leave room for error, since this is actually a zone and not a line.

### Reliability of S&R
As with anything in TA, it is all based on probabilities and S&R only provide likelihoods of reversal 

However, well drawn S&Rs with well-spaced time intervals are very-well respected by the stock.


### Optimisation and checklist
It is almost always better to identify good signals that are going to give good returns than identifying millions of tiny trades that are basically worthless (unless you're in HFT?). 

If two signals are giving the same "vibes"(indication), for eg.a bullish  maurbuzo near the support price, it's a much stronger signal to buy than each of them in isolation. 

Thus we can develop a checklist for every trade considered. 

Remember being disciplined and not getting carried away by feelings. 

A beginner checklist can look something like this:
1. The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern
2. S&R should confirm to the trade, and the stop-loss should be around S&R prices i.e. for a long trade, the low of the pattern should be around the support; for a short trade, the high of the pattern should be around the resistance.


## Topic 5: Volumes
Volumes indicate the cumulative number of shares bought and sold over a given period of time. For eg, a transaction where I buy a 100 shares and you sell them to me doesn't result in the volume being 200, but only a 100, since only 100 exchanged hands in this transaction. But a separate transaction of, say 200 shares, would bring up the total volume to 300.

### Volume trend table
Volume as a metric on it's own is quite useless. However, when associated with preceding price and volume trend, this information becomes meaningful.

|Price | Volume | Expectation|
|------|--------|------------|
|Increases| Increases| Bullish|
|Increases| Decreases| Caution: weak hands buying|
|Decreases| Increases| Bearish|
|Decreases| Decreases| Caution: weak hands selling|

The increase in volume is generally referenced with respect to tha 10 day moving average of volume.

High Volume => $V_t> \bar{V}_{10d}$ 

Low Volume => $V_t< \bar{V}_{10d}$ 

Average Volume => $V_t\approx \bar{V}_{10d}$ 

Psychology: A large volume implies that institutional investors are showing interest in the stock. Now because they have such a large corpus to maintain, any money they invest has to be well managed and thus is considered smart money. Thus it is considered wise for the retail investor to align itself with the smart money. 

Thus always ensure the volumes are substantial, as you're going with the smart money.

The second and fourth rows are explained by the fact that there is only retail investment happening and thus a trend can't be said to form.

### Updated checklist
1. The stock should form a recognisable candlestick pattern
2. S&R should confirm the trade, and the stop-loss should be arund S&R.
3. Volumes should confirm to the trade.

## Topic 6: Moving Averages
Calculated for the latest n data points. Moving averages for stocks are generally calculated using closing prices as it is the price at which the market finally settles down.

### Simple moving averages
A moving average calculated this way is called a simple moving average or SMA. a moving average over 5 days is called a 5 day SMA, which we could then overlay over the candlestick chart to compare

### Exponential moving averages
An SMA gives equal weightage to each considered data point. However, for something as volatile as stocks, it makes more sense to give weightage to the more recent data than the older one(*markets discount everything*).

By now giving the newness of data importacne, we created an exponential set of weights, and using this scaled set of numbers gives us the exponential moving average 

$$
EMA_{i}=\alpha V_i +(1-\alpha) EMA_{i-1}
$$

This is the recurrence relation which gives us the formula to calculate the EMA for a certain $\alpha \in (0,1)$ which is representative of the sanctity we assign to the newness of the value $V$ coming in.

The EMA is more reactive to the movement of prices and thus sticks closer to the candlestick chart prices.

### A simple application of moving averages
Moving averages can be used to identify buying and selling opportunities in its own right. If a stock is trading above the EMA, it means traders are willing to buy it a price higher than the average price, which means they are optimistic and bullish sentiments flourish. Thus the trader should look for buying opportunities. 

If the stock is trading below it's EMA, the traders are pessimistic about its movement and one should look for selling opportunities.

We can try to make a simple trading system based solely on the 50 day EMA. A good system gives signals to enter and a signal to close out of the trade. We can define this system with the following rules:

1. Go long on the stock when the current market price is greater than the 50-day EMA. Once entered the long, you should stay invested until necessary sell is satisfied
2. Exit the long position(square off) when the market price goes below the 50-day EMA.

A particular characteristic of such moving average trading systems is that they perform handsomely in uptrends and downtrends but fail miserably in a side-to-side movement.  Thus a moving average system in it's simplest form is a trend following system. 

Moving averages will give a lot of buy and sell signals in a sideways market which result in worthless trades if not losses. But one of these trades may happen in an upcoming uptrend which may lead to massive gains.

It's really difficult to segregate the big winner from the smaller trades, and thus you should always stick to the system once you adopt it, since the losses are marginal but the gains fromone big rally are going to be impressive.

The profit making trade also ensure that the trader is in the trend for as long as the trend lasts, which can last for many months. Thus, MA can be used as proxy for identifying long term investment ideas.

### Moving average crossover system
This is an improvisation over the previous system, which was prone to generating too many signals. 

In an MA crossover system, instead of the single moving average, the trader combines two moving averages. This is referred to as smoothing.

A typical example would be to combine a 50-day EMA with a 100-day EMA. The shorter MA is also referred to as the faster moving average, and the longer the slower. 

The shorter MA sticks closer to the candle chart, and reacts more quickly. The longer MA's reactions are slower.

One trading scheme here has combined the plain MA system with these two MAs to smoothen out. This generate fewer signals, but each of these signals has a higher chance of being a winner. Here are the rules.

1. Buy(fresh long) when the faster MA turns greater than the slower MA. Stay in the trade as long as this is satisfied.
2. Square off when the faster MA goes under the slower MA.


Some popular MA crossover systems are:
1. 9-day x 21-day: for short terms(upto few trading sessions)
2. 25-day x 50-day: medium terms(upto few weeks)
3. 50-day x 100-day: trades last upto a few months
4. 100-day x 200-day: to identify long term trades(investment opportunities), can last a year or more.

Remember, all MA systems are in the end trend following systems.

## Topic 7: Indicators
Indicators a re trading systems on top of what we already discussed based on the experience of successful traders(or maybe maths?). These can be used to help in buying, selling, confirming and sometimes predicting trends.

Indicators are of two types: Leading and Lagging. 

A leading indicator leads the markets i.e. predicts new trends and reversals before they happen. But they are notorious for giving many false signals. Thus the trader should be very careful when using these.

A majority of these leading indicators are called oscillators as they oscillate within a bounded range, with it typically bouncing between the extremes, rarely at the mean. Based on the value, the interpretation may vary.

A lagging indicator lags the market and confirms the trend after it has occured. This allows traders to cash in on the trend a bit later, but a bit more assuredly. Moving averages is such a lagging indicator.

Momentum: The rate at which price changes. The more rapid the change, the higher the momentum(either upwards or downwards)

### Relative Strength Index-RSI
Developed by J. Welles Wilder. It's a leading momentum indicator which helps
