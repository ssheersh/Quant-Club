# Fundamental Analysis:
FA is a holistic approach to study a business, to invest in a business for the long term (3-$\infty$) years. At these timescales the trends that we looked for in TA become meaningless background noise and the fundamental merit of the business as a whole stands.

Skills to become a FA:

* Understanding financial statements
* Understanding the business concernign the industry it operates in
*  Excel skills

Typically, 60% of your corpus should be in FA investments, while you can use 40% of your money to fool around in TA.

## Mindset of an investor

There are 3 types of market participants in the world of retail investment:
*Speculators, Traders and Investors*

* Speculators are people who base their market decisions on quick thinking and primitive logic, without any backtesting as such.

* Traders apply the logical thinking and backtesting to short-term trades to earn money in TA.

* Investors apply their market knowledge to the long term and use the luxury of time provided by the markets to the full potential

Investors can leverage the luxury of time because of the compounding effect of good investment in the long term


Investors will look out for investable grade attributes in a company which can be both *Qualitative and Quantitative*

*The Qualtitative aspects are:*
* The managements background and competency
* Business ethics
* Corporate governance
* Treatment of minority shareholders
* Share transactions
* Related party transactions
* Salaries paid to promoters
* Operator activity in stocks(higly illegal most of the time)
* Shareholders of the firm
* Political exposure of the promoters
* Promoter lifestyle

*The Quantitative aspects are:*
* Profitability and it's growth
* Margins and it's growth
* Earnings and it's growth
* Expenses(in wider contexts)
* Operating efficiency
* Pricing power
* Matters related to taxes
* Dividends payout
* Cash flow
* Debt(short and long term)
* Working capital management
* Asset growth
* Investments
* Financial ratios
* Other sector related indices

## How to read the Annual report of the company

This is the official word of mouth of the company and is generally the source you want to look for since they have to disclose everything(or they are in deep trouble). 

The media might be manipulated, or (more innocuously) might not wanna focus on thing we as FAs want to see.

Here, we're gonna take ARBL's annual report of 2013-2014(Acche din aane wale the) as the running example, but all annual reports follow roughly the same pattern of 9 sections:
* Financial Highlights
* The Management Statement 
* Management Discussion and Analysis
* 10-year financial highlights
* Corporate information
* Director's Report
* Report on Corporate Governance
* Financial Section, and
* Notice

*Financial Highlights*: This contains the bird's eye view on how the company's financials look for the year gone by. This can be in the form of a table or pretty but heinious to scrap graphical displays. This section also makes a multi-year comparison of the operating and business metrics.

The statments here are basically extracts from the financial statements, and can also include a few financial ratios calculated by the company itself.

### Few Important reports
The next 2 sections to focus on are *Management Statement/ Chairman's Message* and *Management Discussion and Analysis*. It's worht spending time here. Some *qualitative* aspects can also be found here

*Management Statment*: This give idea about what is going on in the top-level manager's head, about how much he is in sync with ground reality and how he positions the business.

*Management Discussion and Analysis*: Very important section of the AR. Most companies start by talking about the macro trends of the economy and sentiments accross the corporate world in their industry. If they have a high exposure to exports, they may also talk about the global economy.

After this, they usually talk about industry trends and what they expect the year ahead, and we can see the company's own SWOT analysis. Compare this section with the company's peers to see if the company has $\delta$ over it's peers.

Then, this dives into various aspects related to it's business and what it has in store for them. It talks about the company's performance accross various divisions, how it fares compared to previous year etc.
Specific numbers are given here.

Some companies even discuss their guidelines and strategies for the year ahead across the various verticals.

After this, it includes other reports such as HR, R&D etc. 

### Financial Statements

3 financial statements that every company presents:

1. Profit and Loss statement
2. Balance sheet
3. Cash flow statement

These come in two forms: *Standalone and Consolidated*

To understand the difference, we need to look at ownership structures. Companies own other companies and when a parent company publishes it's AR, by including the profits and losses of its subsidiaries they form a consolidated P&L statement

-  Say company A owns company B. If A loses Rs. 1000 Crores, but B makes 700 Crores, the consolidated P&L show a loss of Rs. 300 crores. 

### Schedules of Financial Statements
 When a company reports financial statements, they usually report the full statement and then follow it up with detailed explanation, in the notes written on the table.
 
## Understanding the P&L statement
Financial statements can be looked at from the *maker and the user* perspective.

The maker is typically with an accounting background, and his objective is to prepare transparent financial statements that best represent the company's true financial position. Typically CA's do this.

The user only needs to understand what the maker prepared, and need not conecern himself with specific invoices or receipts.

tl;dr: You don't need to be a CA to become and FA.

We saw 3 financial statements:

1. P&L statement
2. Balance sheet
3. Cash flow statement

We'll first study the P&L statement, aka. Income statement, Statement of Operations, and Statement of Earnings.

This statement reports on:

1. Revenue of company in the given period
2. Expenses incurred
3. Tax and depreciation
4. Earnings per share

You should comb through this document yourself and calcualte ratios for yourself.

### Top line of the company(Revenue)
This is the first set of numbers present in the statement.

Taking a look at the headings:

|Particulars |Note no. |Year ended March 31, 2014 | Year ended March 31, 2013|
|-----|-----|-----|---|

1. All values are calculated wrt 31st March, the ending of the financial year in India
2. All currency is denominated in Millions of Rupees. 
3. Particulars show all the main headings of statment, any notes associated are listed in note section/schedule. 
4. The year gone by and the previous year are compared, with the more recent one on the left.

The first item on the revenue side is called the **Sale of products**

For Amar Raja (Amaron), this would be the rupee value of all the battery sales during FY14.

The next item is the excise duty, which is the tax paid by the company to the government, hence requiring revenue to be adjusted.

The revenue after adjustment is called **net sales of the company**.

The company also draws revenue from services, such as maintainance. 

Then there are other operating revenues which can be in the form of sale of other products such as battery oil (say).


Finally, Sales+Services+Other Revenues=Total operating revenue
  
 We can check note for more details. 
 
 Usually other income should be a very small percentage of the total revenue. A large percentage of other incomes is a red flag.
 
 ### Expense details 
 
 Expenses are classified according to their (function, which is also called the cost of sales method) or based on the expense's nature. The analysis will be attached in the notes.
 

In Amaron's case, the first item is **Cost of materials consumed**, fair enough, the raw material to make batteries.

The next items are **Purchases of stock in trade** and **Change in inventories of finished good, work-in-progress & stock-in-trade**.

**Purchases of stock in trade** refers to all the purchases of finished goods that company buys for conducting its business. 

**Change in inventories of finished good, work-in-progress & stock-in-trade** refers to costs of manufacturing incurred by the company in the past, but the goods manufactured in the past were sold in current year.
A negative number here indicates that the company produced more than it managed to sell. To get a sense of proportion, the company deducts the cost incurred in manufacturing the extra goods from the current year costs. The company will add these cost back in **Purchases of stock-in-trade** when they have managed to sell these products in future. 

tl;dr learn more in the Financial Modelling section.

The next expense is **Employee benefits expenses**, which includes salaries paid, provident funds, and other welfare expenses. 
(side note, the salaries are quite small it seems)

The next expense is **Finance cost/Finance charges/Borrowing Costs**. This is essentially what you pay for borrowing funds.

The next expense id **Depreciation and Amortization**. To learn about this, we have to understand how assets are work and factored in.

Assets have a span of useful life, and once acquired, continue to provide value for a number of years. By distributing the cost of acquiring over the lifetime of the asset, the company can more truly show its growth and profitability potential. This cost is factored in as depreciation

The depreciation for non-tangible assets is called amortization.

Including this cost as depreciation does show the true profit and loss but then the P&L statement fails to account for the cashflow of the lumpsum for purchasing the asset. This cash-flow is captured in the cash-flow statement.

Other expenses may not be a red flag here, because for a distributor like Amaron, hardware stores, power and fuel etc. can all add up. However, it is still worth looking into the breakdown of other expenses. 

### Profit before tax

PBT= Total revenue - Total operating expnenses - Extraordinary expenses.

Extraordinary expenses are those that the company couldn't have possible seen coming.

### Net profit after taxes

This is the bottom line of the P&L statement and the name pretty much explains itself.

The last line is EPS, a very sacred number which shows how much profit the company is earning per face value of ordinary share. 

$$EPS=\frac{Net\ Profit }{Total\ Outstanding\ Shares}$$

## Understanding the Balance Sheet

The P&L statement gives us an idea about the company's profitability, balance sheet gives us an idea about the company's assets, liabilities, and shareholder's equity.

P&L statement is standalone for the current FY. But the Balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis i.e. it has financial information on the company right from when it was started.

Assets are resources controlled by company and have an economic value in the future.

Liabilities are obligations of the company, almost exactly a loan.

In a typical balance sheet, Assets=Liabilities, because everything that is owned by company was purchased on a loan or the owner's capital.

Owner's capital is the difference between Assets and liabilities, Also known as Shareholder's equity or net-worth.

Shareholder equity=Assets-Liabilities

Why is shareholder's equity filed under Liabilities? To make sense of this, think of the company as an individual whose sole job is to manage company and create wealth for shareholders. Then the Shareholder equity is the money the shareholder loaned out to this individual.

### Liabilities
There are 3 subsections here:

1. Shareholder's equity
2. Non-current liabilities
3. Current liabilities

To understand share capital, it's the money of the investors.

Share capital = Face value of the stock(FV) * Number of shares in the open market.

Thus, Number of shares= Share capital/FV

The next item on the liability side is **Reserves and Surplus**. Reserves are usually money earmarked by the company for a specific purpose. Surplus is where the profits for the company reside. 

ARBL in this case has earmarked funds accross 3 kinds of reserves:

1. Capital reserves: Usually reserved for long term projects
2. Securities premium reserve/account: This is where the premium over and above the shares' face/par value sits
3. General reserve: This is where all the profits not yet distributed to the shareholders reside. This money can be used as a buffer.

The next section deals with surplus. This holds the profit made during the year. The current year profit is added to last year closing balance of surplus. This shows that balance sheet is prepared on a flow basis.

Some of the money from surplus is transferred to the general reserve. Some more is distributed as dividends to the shareholders, and have to also pay a dividend distribution fees.

After removing these expenditures, what's left is the closing balance which will be the opening balance for the next year.

Now, shareholder's fund is the sum of share capital and reserves & surplus as this is the money that belongs to shareholder's.

#### Non-current liabilities

These represent the company's long term obligations, which it doesn't intend to pay of within the next 365 days of the balance sheet date, and stay on the books for a few years. 

The company has 3 types of non-current liabilities:

1. Long term borrowing
2. Deferred Tax Liability
3. Long term provisions

Long term borrowings is the most important here as it represents the money the company has borrowed from various sources, and used to calculate many financial ratios.

For ARBL, most long term borrowing is in the form of 'interest-free sales tax deferment', which seems like some tax incentive which they plan to settle in 14 years. 

It's generally good if a company doesn't have much debt, but the reason for no debt must be inquired. Is it because banks are refusing to lend it money or is it because it's not trying to expand its business operations?

Now, if the debt of the company was high, the finance cost would've been high too.

*Deferred tax liability* is a provision for future tax payments. This is because the company forsees it may have to pay additional tax in future due to the way depreciation is treated within the income tax(too much of a rabbit hole).

tl;dr deferred tax liability arises due to treatment of depreciation.

The last item is long term provisions which is usually set aside for employee benefits such as gratuity; leave encashment, provident funds etc.

#### Current Liabilities

Current liabilities are a company's obligations which are expected to be settled within the next 365 days.

ARBL has 4 items in current liabilities. 

The first item, Short term borrowings are loans taken out for day to day operations (also called working capital requirements)

The next line is trade playable (aka account payable). These are obligations to vendors who supply to the company eg. raw materials, service centers etc.

Other current liabilities are obligations not directly related to company's operations such as employee related payables, service tax etc. 

Short term provisions are quite similar to long term provisions in that they are set aside for funds such as employee benefits etc.

Total Liability = Shareholders’ Funds + Non Current Liabilities + Current Liabilities

### Assets

Assets are also classified as non-current and current assets.

#### Non Current Assets
These are further divided into two:

1. Fixed assets
2. Other line items

##### Fixed assets
These are items (both tangible and intangible) that the company owns which cannot be liquidated easily. Intangible assets are also considered fixed because they benefit companies over a long period of time.

All assets depreciate over their useful life. Kepping this in perspective, when the company acquires an asset, it's called the 'Gross Block'. Depreciation should be deducted from the gross block from which we can arrive at the nect block:

Net block = Gross Block - Accumulated Depreciation

Accumulated i.e. starting from incorporation.

Current Value= Previous year value + Additions this year - Deductions this year

Total Depreciation= Previous year depreciation + Current year's depreciation - Deductions this year

The next items are *Capital Work In Progress* and *Intangible Assets under Development*

CWIP includes buildings under development etc. This is mentioned in the net block section. This is work that isn't complete yet but where capital expenditure is already incurred. Once the work is done, this is moved to tangible assets.

The last line is *Intangible assets under development*. This is similar to CWIP but for intangible assets. Work such as copyright filing, brand development etc. 

##### Other Line items

Besides fixed assets in non-current, there are other line items as well.

Non-current investments are investments made by ARBL with long term perspective. This could be anything from buying listed equity shares, minority stake in other companies, debentures, mutual funds etc. 

The next item is long-term loans and advances (that ARBL makes to other companies, employees, suppliers etc.)

The last line includes 'Other Non-current assets', which are too small to be worth discussing.


#### Current assets

These are assets easily convertible to cash and the company forsees a situation of consuming these within the next 365 days. These are used to fund day-to-day operations and ongoing expenses.

The most common current assets are cash and cash equivalents, inventories, receivables, short term loans and sundry debtors.

For ARBL, the main assets are:

1. Inventories
2. Trade receivables
3. Cash and cash equivalents
4. Short term loans and balances
5. Others

Inventories include finished goods manufactured, raw materials in stock and goods manufactured incompletely etc. These aren't ready to be sold yet but will be within the next year. From the associated notes, we can see the bulk of this is 'Raw Materials' and 
'Works in Progress'.

The next item is 'Trade recievables', which is the amount of money it is expected to receive from its distributors, and other parties. 

The next item is cash and cash equivalents, the most liquid assets. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity rate of fewer than 3 months.

The next item is short-term loans and advances that the company has tendered and expects to be repaid in the next 365 days. These could be advance tax payments, laons to employees etc.

Other current assets are marginal, and not worth discussing.

##### Connecting the P&L and Balance sheet

|P&L|&rarr;| Balance Sheet|
|---|------|--------------|
|Sales Revenue||Receivables and Cash Balance|
|Operating expenses||Inventory and Trade Payables|
|Depreciation & Amortisation||Accumulated Depreciation|
|Other income||Investments|
|Finance cost||Debt|
|PAT||Shareholder's equity|

## Cash Flow Statement

This statement reveals how much cash the company is actually generating. How is this different from a P&L though?

This becuase in P&L we talk about stuff such as credit and distributing the cost of acquiring an asset over time. Now that may be true, but then P&L doesn't reflect exactly how much cash or liquid money got exchanged. 

Thus, to check the actual cash flows happening, we go to the Cash Flow Statement (THE SVB bank defaulted this way so this is important stuff)

### Activities of a company 

Company activities can be classified under 3 standard baskets:

1. *Operational Activities(OA)*: Activities related to daily core business. These include sales, marketing, manufacturing, technology upgrade, resource hiring etc.
2. *Investing Actvities(IA)*: Activities about investment that the company makes intending to reap the benefits at the later stages. These include equity shares, investing in land, property, plant and equipment, intangibles and non-current assets etc.
3. *Financing Activites(FA)*: Activities all about financial transactions og thr company such as distributing dividends, rasing fresh debt, issuing corporate bonds etc.

Now, each activity that the company undertakes has an impact on the cash balance. 

By observation, we see that:

1. Whenever th liabilities of the company increase, the cash balance also increases and a decrease also works the same way.
2.Whenever the assets of the company increase, the cash balance decreases and the same happens for decreases.

Each of the 3 activities listed either produces cash of reduces cash

Cash flow of the company= Net cash flow from operating activities + Net cash flow from investing activities+ Net cash flow from financing activities.


### Cash flow statement 

Typically, companies split the statement into 3 segments to explicitly show how much cash the company has generated accross the 3 actvities. 

A company with +ve cash flow from operating activities is always a positive sign.

Investing activities generally take up money(Assets &uarr; ; Cash &darr;). However, one should look if this is healthy or unhealthy

 a guzzling of cash  in financing activities indicate that it hasn't taken on debt and is paying back the previous loans.
 
 ## Financial Ratios
 Made popular by Benjamin Graham. Help us evaluate a copany against iteself and against other companies.
 
 On it's own, these financial ratios convey quite little information.
 
 Be on the look-out for different accounting practices here.
 
 Financial ratios can be somewhat loosely classifies into different categories namely:

1. Profitability ratios: THey measure how well the company generates profit and hence how competitive the management is. 
2. Leverage ratios: Solvency/Gearing ratios, which measures the company's long term ability to sustain it's day to day operations, and how much the company is using debt to finance growth.
3. Valuation ratios: Compare the stock price with either profitability of overall value to get a sense of how cheap or expensive the stock is trading. It compares the cost of securitty with the perks of owning it.
4. Operating ratios: aka Acitivity ratios which measure the efficiency the business can convert its assets to revenues,  and thus how efficient the management is. Thus, these are also known as Management ratios.

### Profitability ratios

We'll look into the following:
1. EBIDTA Margin (Operating Profit Margin)
	* EBIDTA growth (CAGR)
2. PAT Margin
	* PAT growth
3. Return on Equity (ROE)
4. Return on Asset (ROA)
5. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

#### EBITDA: Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation & Amortization Margin

This indicates the efficiency of the management and the company model. EBITDA Margin tells us how profitable (in percentage terms) the company is at an operating level. It always makes sense to compare the company’s EBITDA margin versus its competitor to get a sense of the management’s efficiency in terms of managing their expense.

$$\text{EBITDA =[Operating Revenus]-[Operating Expense]=[Total Revenue- Other Income]-[Total Expense - Finance Cost -Depreciation and Amortization]}$$

$$\text{EBITDA\ Margin}=\frac{EBITDA}{Operating\ Revenue}$$
